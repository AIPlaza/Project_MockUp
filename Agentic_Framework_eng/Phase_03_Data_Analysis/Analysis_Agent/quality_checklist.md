# Quality Checklist: Statistical Analysis Report

## Objective

To ensure the `Statistical_Analysis_Report.md` is accurate, logically sound, and correctly interprets the research data before it is used to formulate final conclusions and recommendations.

---

### Part 1: Data Integrity & Accuracy

- [ ] **Data Consistency:** Do the totals in the analysis tables match the provided sample size (n)?
- [ ] **Calculation Verification:**
    - [ ] Spot-check at least two frequency-to-percentage calculations to ensure they are correct.
    - [ ] If advanced statistics (mean, standard deviation) are used, verify the calculations for at least one dimension.
    - [ ] Confirm that the "Promedio de la dimensión" and "Promedio general de la variable" are calculated correctly from the item data.
- [ ] **Graphing Specifications:** Are the specifications for the recommended visualizations (bar charts, pie charts) clear, correct, and based on the data?

### Part 2: Interpretive Coherence

- [ ] **Interpretation Validity:** Does the written `Interpretación` for items and dimensions logically follow from the numerical data presented?
- [ ] **Alignment with Findings:** Do the `HALLAZGOS PRINCIPALES` directly correspond to the most significant results from the data analysis?
- [ ] **Grounded in Data:** Verify that the "Dimensión más fuerte" and "Dimensión más débil" are correctly identified based on the data.
- [ ] **Theoretical Triangulation:** In Section 8 (`TRIANGULACIÓN CON MARCO TEÓRICO`), is the connection between the statistical result and the cited author/theory logical and well-explained?
- [ ] **No Overreaching:** Does the analysis avoid making claims or generalizations that are not directly supported by the data sample?

---

### Part 3: Report Structure & Completeness

- [ ] **All Sections Present:** Verify that the report is structured according to the 8-part format specified in the prompt template.
- [ ] **Clarity of Language:** Is the report written in clear, academic prose? Are the findings easy to understand for a stakeholder who is not a statistician?
- [ ] **Item Text Included:** Does the analysis "por ítem" include the actual text of the item, providing necessary context?
- [ ] **Actionable Insights:** Do the `ÁREAS DE MEJORA IDENTIFICADAS` clearly and logically derive from the items with the poorest results?
