# Quality Checklist: Final Report (Conclusions & Action Plan)

## Objective

To ensure the final outputs of the research project are logical, well-founded, actionable, and directly answer the initial research objectives. This checklist is divided into two parts to validate the two primary artifacts from this phase.

---

### Part 1: Validation of `Conclusions.md`

- [ ] **Directly Answers Objectives:** Does each "Conclusión por Objetivo Específico" directly and clearly answer the corresponding objective from the `INFORMACIÓN DEL ESTUDIO`?
- [ ] **Evidence-Based:** Is every conclusion explicitly supported by a specific statistic or finding from the `Statistical_Analysis_Report.md`? (CRITICAL: No new data or unsupported claims).
- [ ] **Theoretical Link:** Is there a clear and logical connection made to the theoretical framework mentioned in the analysis?
- [ ] **Distinction from Results:** Do the conclusions provide a synthesis or an interpretation, rather than simply restating the results from the analysis phase?
- [ ] **Methodological Reflection:** Does the "Conclusión Metodológica" provide a reasonable and critical reflection on the study's own process, including limitations?
- [ ] **Holistic View:** Does the "Conclusión General" accurately synthesize the specific conclusions into a coherent, big-picture summary?

### Part 2: Validation of `Action_Plan.md`

- [ ] **Based on Conclusions:** Is every `RECOMENDACIÓN ESTRATÉGICA` directly linked to a specific weakness or strength identified in the `Conclusions.md`? The `FUNDAMENTACIÓN` section must be clear on this.
- [ ] **Actionability:** Are the proposed actions specific, concrete, and understandable? (Avoid vague suggestions like "improve communication").
- [ ] **SMART Principles:** For at least one strategic recommendation, verify if it is:
    - **S**pecific: Is the objective clear?
    - **M**easurable: Are the `INDICADORES DE ÉXITO` clear and quantifiable?
    - **A**chievable: Are the `RECURSOS ESTIMADOS` and `PLAZO` realistic for the organization's context?
    - **R**elevant: Does the recommendation directly address a key problem?
    - **T**ime-bound: Is there a clear `PLAZO` defined?
- [ ] **Prioritization:** Does the plan distinguish between short, medium, and long-term actions, providing a clear roadmap?
- [ ] **Hierarchical Coherence:** Are the `RECOMENDACIONES TÁCTICAS/OPERATIVAS` logical derivations of the higher-level strategic recommendations? Do they make sense for the functional areas (`Operaciones`, `Administrativa`, etc.)?
- [ ] **Risk Assessment:** Are the potential risks identified, and are the proposed mitigation strategies reasonable?

### Validation Verdict

- [ ] **Approved:** The final conclusions and action plan are robust, evidence-based, and actionable. The `Orchestrator_Agent` can assemble and deliver the `Final_Research_Report.md`.
- [ ] **Approved with Minor Revisions:** The documents are largely acceptable but require specific adjustments for clarity or feasibility. (List revisions below).
- [ ] **Rejected:** The documents contain significant logical gaps, unsupported conclusions, or unrealistic recommendations. They must be regenerated by the `Reporting_Agent`. (Provide detailed feedback below).

**Feedback/Required Revisions:**
1.  `...`
2.  `...`
