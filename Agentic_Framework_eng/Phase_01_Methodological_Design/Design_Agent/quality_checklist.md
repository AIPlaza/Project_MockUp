# Quality Checklist: Methodological Design Document

## Objective

To ensure the `Methodological_Design_Document.md` is robust, coherent, and feasible before proceeding to the next phase of research. This checklist is to be used by a `Validation_Agent` or a human reviewer.

---

### Part 1: Completeness Check

- [ ] **All Sections Present:** Verify that all 7 main sections from the template are present in the document.
- [ ] **No Empty Placeholders:** Ensure no `[...]` placeholders remain in the final document. Every section should be filled out.
- [ ] **Justifications Provided:** Confirm that every classification (e.g., Enfoque, Diseño, Nivel) includes a clear and logical justification.

---

### Part 2: Coherence & Alignment

- [ ] **Alignment with Objectives:** Does the chosen methodology directly address the `Objetivo general` and `Objetivos específicos`?
- [ ] **Internal Consistency:**
    - Are the `Técnicas e Instrumentos` (Section 3) appropriate for the `Tipo de Investigación` (Section 1)? (e.g., using surveys for a quantitative study).
    - Does the `Análisis` plan (Section 5) match the data that will be gathered by the `Instrumentos` (Section 3)?
    - Is the `Cronograma` (Section 7) realistic given the chosen methods and specified `Recursos disponibles`?
- [ ] **Variable Congruence:** Are the variables mentioned in Section 1 consistently addressed in Sections 2 (Population), 3 (Instruments), and 5 (Analysis)?

---

### Part 3: Feasibility & Rigor

- [ ] **Population & Sample:**
    - Is the `Población Objetivo` clearly defined with specific inclusion/exclusion criteria?
    - Is the chosen `Tipo de Muestreo` justified and practical?
    - If a sample was calculated, is the formula and its parameters applied correctly?
- [ ] **Instruments:**
    - Is the choice of `Técnica` and `Instrumento` for each variable appropriate and well-defended?
- [ ] **Validation Plan:**
    - Is the `Validación de Contenido` plan (Juicio de expertos) clear, with defined profiles for the experts?
    - Is the `Confiabilidad` plan (e.g., Alpha de Cronbach) appropriate for the proposed instrument and does it include a pilot test?
- [ ] **Ethical Considerations:**
    - Does the document include all the necessary ethical checks (Consentimiento, Confidencialidad, etc.)? Are they appropriate for the described study?

---

### Validation Verdict

- [ ] **Approved:** The document meets all quality criteria and the project can proceed to Phase 2.
- [ ] **Approved with Minor Revisions:** The document is largely acceptable but requires specific, minor changes. (List revisions below).
- [ ] **Rejected:** The document has significant flaws in coherence, feasibility, or completeness and must be regenerated by the `Design_Agent`. (Provide detailed feedback below).

**Feedback/Required Revisions:**
1.  `...`
2.  `...`
3.  `...`
